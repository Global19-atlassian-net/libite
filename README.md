libite
======

libite is a set of header-based intrusive containers in C++, originally part
of [liboco](https://github.com/pallas/liboco) and created as an exercise for
the author.  It is not meant as a replacement for other, similar template
libraries.

While libite is just a toy, the intention is to continue to add features and
new containers.
